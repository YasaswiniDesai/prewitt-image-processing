Prewitt edge detection is a type of edge detection algorithm used in image processing and computer vision. It's named after its inventor, Judith M. Prewitt. The goal of edge detection algorithms like Prewitt is to identify and highlight the boundaries of objects within an image.

The Prewitt kernels for horizontal and vertical edge detection are as follows:

# Horizontal Prewitt Kernel:
```
-1  0  1
-1  0  1
-1  0  1
```
